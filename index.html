      <h1>Hello World!</h1>

      <p>Welcome to my little section of the web! My name is Beth Pauley and I'm a Web Developer. My passion is blending design, technology, and interaction.</p>

      <h1>A Little About Me...</h1>

      <p>I work as a web developer at the <a href="https://scottsmiraclegro.com/" target="https://scottsmiraclegro.com/">Scotts Miracle-Gro</a> company focusing on our external branded sites.
        After graduating from <a href="https://miamioh.edu/" target="https://miamioh.edu/">Miami University</a>, I was able to go from intern to full-time associate at Scotts.
        Over the past 7 years I have gone from primarily doing design and development of the frontend to contributing to our backend code.
        This past year I was the Tech Lead over our smaller brand sites.</p>

      <p>My love of technology started off when I was young.
        I started off playing games on our Sega and computer.
        The game I remember most fondly is RollerCoaster Tycoon.
        I loved the power of creation I had to design the park the way I wanted.
        The thill seeker in me also loved the power to build rides bigger and better than the ones in the real world (I also liked the part where I earned lots of money).</p>

      <p>Another passion that started early for me was travel.
        I have traveled quite a lot for family vacations and was forunate enough to study abroad in South Korea for one semester at Korea University.
        You can be certain there is some new adventure being planned.</p>

These suggestion are based off my own experiences while studying abroad there.</p>
              <p>For the second iteration, I wanted to focus on making the images a more promenent part of the site and giving the it amodern feel but also making it into a single page as there is no real reason for it the be multiple pages.</p>

              <p>This site initially started off as a project for one of my college classes.  After learning how to use JavaScript, the objective was to use javascript and three different jQuery widgets in a website.</p>
              <p>However, quite some time has past and this really needed to be updated. This time around I focused on improving the UI and UX as well as making site responsive.</p>
              <p>Since this is a history site would it not make more sense to make it into a timeline? This gives users a better sense of time by displaying events in the order that they happen. There was no major content changes just reordering and updating what was already existing.</p>

              <p>This project focused on modes of inquiring, probing and experimenting.
              Goal was not to create narrative structures or persuasive speech (the dominant form in video composition), but rather to try something uncertain, to provoke, to confound or even confuse, to evoke an emotion, or to illuminate.</p>
              <p>The process was to experiment and try things, to see what worked and then dig deeper into them. There were three phases to create the video.
              In phase one, the task was to create a 45-90 second video filming thing we found interesting.
              In phase two, the task was to create a revised 60-120 second video based on feedback received during class discussion of videos.
              Lastly, phase three was to create final video keeping in mind feedback received during class discussion on video two.</p>

              Using Processing, we created animations.  These animations were complied as a series of images and sent to a laser cutter.
              From there the cut out images needed to be assembled.  To get to the final form it went through two iterations which can be seen above.</p>

            So what is Interactive Media Studies?
          </p>
          <p>"Interactive media is the integration of digital media, including combinations of electronic text, graphics, moving images, and sound, into a structured digital computerized environment that allows people to interact with the data for appropriate purposes. Interactive Media Studies is an interdisciplinary program that brings together students and faculty throughout the university to investigate how interactive media informs and transforms their disciplinary perspective. Through problem-based learning and team-oriented projects, students learn how to apply their theoretical knowledge to innovative digital solutions."
